# trafficLightControllerUsing8051
This 8051-based traffic light controller cycles through red (20s), blue (5s), and green (15s) signals, displaying each state on an LCD. A 7-segment display shows the countdown timer. Timer0 generates 1s interrupts to update the countdown. The system ensures smooth transitions with proper LCD updates and multiplexed 7-segment display control.
